# Digital_Modulation
This repo contains MATLAB scripts for digital modulation techniques (ASK, FSK and PSK) in wireless communications

Digital modulation involves encoding digital data into a carrier wave for transmission. It allows efficient and reliable communication over various mediums, such as radio, optical, or wired channels. Common digital modulation techniques include:

**Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):** Encodes data by varying the carrier wave's amplitude.
- Simpler but susceptible to noise.
- Used in low-bandwidth applications.

**Frequency Shift Keying (FSK):** Represents data by changing the carrier wave's frequency.
- More noise-resistant than ASK.
- Common in modems and RFID systems.

**Phase Shift Keying (PSK):** Modulates data by altering the carrier wave's phase.
- Highly efficient and widely used in wireless communication.
- Includes variants like BPSK and QPSK.
